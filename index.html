                    <p>Hello! I am a returning student to ASU
                    looking to make a career in programming.
                    Technology is the future and I hope to 
                    impress the tech companies of today with  
                    my expertise and great attitude.  </p>

                    <p>My passion is all things programming, I find the infinite possibilities
                        of the digital space to be a fascinating avenue of creative express and possibility.
                        I want to live in a world where I can make meaningful contributions to the digital space.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My favorite part of the programming process is learning something new.
                         The field of programming is so vast that every new project and day brings new discoveries
                         and chances to learn. I don't think I'll ever have my fill of the possibilities of programming 
                         and I hope to bring that enthusiasm to your work enviornment. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I don't consider myself to be an expert by any stretch of the imagination but I do consider myself
                        an adept learner who will ask the right questions to help speed up the process. I look forward to working
                        with you!
                    </p>
